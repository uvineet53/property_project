              The ventilation system includes heat recovery units. The
              high-quality air flow is ensured by the latest generation of
              energy-efficient MVHR systems. In each room, the purified air with
              HEPA (PM2.5) level circulates while providing heating and cooling.
              With these systems, 93% of the heat is retained in the building,
              significantly reducing utility bills by several thousand lev per
              year.

              When designing "Nishava Residence", a key priority was to provide
              residents with the advantage of natural day-night cycles. French
              windows flood all homes with daylight.
