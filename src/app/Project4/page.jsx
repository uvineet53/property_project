              The ventilation system includes heat recovery units. The

              With these systems, 93% of the heat is retained in the building,
              significantly reducing utility bills by several thousand lev per
              year.

                When designing "Nishava Residence", a key priority was to
                provide residents with the advantage of natural day-night
                cycles. French windows flood all homes with daylight.
